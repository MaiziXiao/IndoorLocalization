# A Deep Learning Approach to Fingerprinting Indoor Localization Solutions
------

This repository is about a data-driven approach to indoor localization. The goalis, as a proof of concept, to show how modern data analytics enable us to build a more powerful indoor localization techniques and make use of those data previously deemed to be useless.
 
The more in-depth discussion of the results are to be found in the following publications:
